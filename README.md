# ExamEval: AI-Powered Exam Grading System

**ExamEval** is an AI-powered exam grading system designed to automatically evaluate subjective answers in exams. This project leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as deep learning models and semantic similarity, to automatically assess and score student answers based on their relevance and correctness compared to standard answers.

## Features

- **Automatic Grading of Subjective Answers**: Use of pre-trained language models to evaluate and grade student-submitted answers.
- **Text Similarity Measurement**: The system calculates the semantic similarity between student responses and predefined correct answers.
- **Customizable Evaluation**: Easily adaptable for various types of questions and exam formats.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides instant grading and feedback for students.
- **Data Collection and Analysis**: Collects and analyzes student performance over time.

## Model Details

The core of this system is a fine-tuned transformer-based model, trained on a variety of datasets containing student answers and corresponding standard answers. The model uses text similarity and semantic analysis to compare answers and assign grades.
